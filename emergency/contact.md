# üìû Who to Call: Contact List of People Who Might Help
## *Or: The Hierarchy of Desperation When Everything Is Broken*

---

## The Beautiful Lie

**What they tell you:** "We have a 24/7 support team and comprehensive escalation procedures!"

**The brutal truth:** You have a three-year-old phone list, half the numbers are disconnected, and the other half go straight to voicemail with a full inbox.

## üé≠ The Support Paradox

```
People who can help you ‚Üí Don't answer their phone
People who answer their phone ‚Üí Can't help you
People who want to help ‚Üí Don't know how
People who know how ‚Üí Already quit
```

import datetime
import pytz

def can_i_call_support(region):

## üéØ The Nuclear Options

### When All Else Fails

1. **Cry**
   - It really really helps
   - Source: Trust me bro

2. **Create a New Support Ticket as a "Potential Customer"**
   - Sales responds faster than support
   - "We're evaluating your platform..."
   - Or just give the support your employee ID they will contact you then

3. **The LinkedIn InMail**
   - Find employees of the vendor
   - Message them directly
   - "I saw you work at [Company]..."

## üö™ The Exit Strategy Contacts

### When You're Done with This

## üìú The Golden Rules of Contact

1. **Document everything** - CYA is a valid strategy
2. **CC your manager** - Share the pain
3. **BCC yourself** - Evidence for later
4. **Follow up** - They won't respond the first time
5. **Follow up again** - Or the second time
6. **Give up** - Accept your fate

---

## üé¨ Final Words

Remember: The best contact is the one that answers. The second best is the one that tries to help. The third best is your rubber duck.

**The Universal Truth:**
> "The person who can fix your problem is always on vacation, just quit, or in a different timezone."

**Contact Effectiveness Formula:**
```
Effectiveness = (Knowledge √ó Availability √ó Willingness) / (Time Since They Left The Company)¬≤
```
