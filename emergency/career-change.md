# Chapter 47: The Logs That Broke Me

It was a dark and stormy night. The logs scrolled endlessly,
each line a testament to failures past. ERROR, WARNING, CRITICAL -
a symphony of despair in monospace font.

"Have you checked the logs?" they asked.
I had been checking the logs for seven hours.
The logs had been checking me.

In the distance, a server crashed. Nobody heard it.
If a service fails in production and monitoring is down,
did it really fail?

The answer, as always, was in the logs.
The logs that never ended.
The logs that never lied.
The logs that broke me.

## üèÉ Career Option #6: Professional Runner

### Why It Makes Sense

- You already run from your problems
- You're used to races (race conditions)

- Runners high > deployment high
- No laptops required

### Training Plan

```bash
# running_training.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Week 1: Escape velocity
while [ $DISTANCE -lt 1km ]; do
    run --away-from "responsibilities"
    DISTANCE++
done

# Week 2-4: Build endurance
for week in {2..4}; do
    run --distance "$((week * 5))km" \
        --pace "slower than CI/CD pipeline" \
        --motivation "no more yaml"
done

# Week 5+: Marathon prep
while not exhausted; do
    run --until "forgot what kubernetes is"
    celebrate --with "carbs not commits"
done

## üìã The Resignation Letter Template

```markdown
Subject: Moving to Production (of Vegetables)

Dear [Manager Name],

After careful consideration and one too many CUDA out of memory errors,
I've decided to pursue new opportunities in sustainable agriculture.

My last day will be [two weeks from now / immediately if production is down].

I'll be happy to document my code (for the first time) and knowledge transfer
to whoever draws the short straw.

Thank you for the opportunity to learn that computers were a mistake.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. - The password to the production database is in the usual place
(I don't know where that is either)
```

## üé¨ Final Words

Remember: Every career has its problems. But at least farmers' bugs can be solved with pesticide, not debugging.

**The Universal Career Truth:**
> "The grass is always greener on the other side because they're not deploying to production on Fridays."

**Your Next Steps:**
1. Finish current sprint (you won't)
2. Document everything (you definitely won't)
3. Train replacement (good luck to them)
4. Update LinkedIn to "Open to Work"
5. Buy farming equipment
6. Realize you miss coding
7. Return to tech in 6 months
8. Repeat cycle
