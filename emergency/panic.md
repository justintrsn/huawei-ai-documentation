# 🔥 The Panic Guide: First Steps When Production Dies
## *Or: How to Look Competent While Everything Burns*

---

## The Beautiful Lie

**What they tell you:** "Our system is highly available with 99.99% uptime!"

**The brutal truth:** That 0.01% always happens at 3 AM on a Friday before a long weekend, and you're the only one who answers the phone.

---

## 🚨 The Immediate Response Protocol

### Step 1: Don't Panic (Panic Internally)

```bash
# Take a deep breath
sleep 3

# Now actually check if it's really broken
curl https://your-app.huaweicloud.com
# Connection refused

# Try again (maybe it was a fluke)
curl https://your-app.huaweicloud.com
# Still connection refused

# One more time (denial is a valid coping mechanism)
curl https://your-app.huaweicloud.com
# Okay, it's actually dead
```

### Step 2: Confirm the Disaster

```bash
# Check from multiple locations (it's not just you)
ssh jumpbox-singapore "curl https://your-app.huaweicloud.com"
ssh jumpbox-hongkong "curl https://your-app.huaweicloud.com"
# Dead everywhere. Excellent.

# Check the status page
curl https://status.huaweicloud.com
# "All Systems Operational" - LIARS
```

### Step 3: Assess the Damage

**The Triage Checklist:**

- [ ] Is the entire app down or just certain features?
- [ ] Are customers complaining? (Check Twitter, it's faster than monitoring)
- [ ] Is the database responding? (Please say yes)
- [ ] Are the AI agents still running? (Oh god, are they STILL RUNNING?)
- [ ] Has the MCP server achieved sentience and decided to strike?

## 🔍 The Investigation Phase

### Check the Usual Suspects

```bash
# 1. The Logs (Your New Best Friend)
docker logs pandas-mcp-server --tail 100
# "CUDA out of memory" - Classic

# 2. The Disk (It's Always the Disk)
df -h
# Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
# /dev/sda1        20G   20G    0G 100% /
# There it is

# 3. The Memory (OOM Killer Strikes Again)
free -h
dmesg | grep -i "killed process"
# "Out of memory: Killed process 1337 (pandas-mcp-server)"

# 4. The CPU (Someone's Mining Bitcoin)
top
# python: 9999% CPU - That's not right

# 5. The Network (DNS, It's Always DNS)
nslookup api.openai.com
# "No response from server"
# It's DNS
```
For ECS specific logs example please check [here](/huawei-mcp-guides/deployment-guides/02-ecs-deployment.md) 

### The Huawei Cloud Special Checks

```bash
# Check if your credit card was declined
echo "Did I pay the bill this month?"
# Narrator: They did not

# Check if someone deleted the security group rules
# (It was you, yesterday, "just for testing")

# Check if the region still exists
# (Yes, this is a real concern with Huawei Cloud)
```

---

## 🛠️ The Fix Attempts

### Level 1: Turn It Off and On Again

```bash
# The universal fix
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

# Still broken? Try harder
docker-compose down -v  # Nuclear option
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate

# STILL broken? 
systemctl restart docker
# Now you've broken Docker too. Good job.
```

### Level 2: Resource Liberation

```bash
# Free up disk space (delete things you'll regret later)
find /var/log -type f -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -delete
docker system prune -a --volumes -f
rm -rf /tmp/*  # Living dangerously

# Free up memory
sync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
pkill -f "python"  # Kill all Python processes (what could go wrong?)

# Free up CPU
nice -n 19 python your_script.py  # Make it polite
```

### Level 3: The Rollback Dance

```bash
# Find the last working commit (there must be one... right?)
git log --oneline | head -20
# All commits say "fix: trying to fix the previous fix"

# Rollback to last week (when things worked)
git checkout HEAD~50  # 50 commits ago was probably stable
docker build -t app:please-work .
docker run app:please-work
# Error: This version requires Python 2.7
# Oh god, how old IS this commit?
```

## 📞 The Escalation Tree

### Who to Wake Up (In Order)

1. **Yourself** - You're already awake, might as well suffer alone first
2. **The Person Who Last Deployed** - They broke it, they fix it
3. **Your Team Lead** - They need to share the pain
4. **That One Person Who Actually Knows How Everything Works** - Probably quit last month
5. **The Vendor Support** - "Your ticket number is 74829567. Expected response time: 72 hours"
6. **The CTO** - Only if customers are leaving
7. **God** - When all else fails

### The Phone Call Script

```python
def wake_up_colleague(name, severity):
    """
    The 3 AM call nobody wants to receive
    """
    greeting = "Hey... sorry to wake you but..."
    
    if severity == "critical":
        message = "Everything is on fire. I need help."
    elif severity == "major":
        message = "We have a situation. Can you check Slack?"
    else:
        message = "When you wake up, we should talk."
    
    prayer = "Please don't hate me."
    
    return f"{greeting} {message} {prayer}"
```

## 🎯 The Quick Fixes That Actually Work

### The 20% That Fixes 80% of Problems

```bash
# 1. Restart the container (seriously, this works so often)
docker restart pandas-mcp-server

# 2. Clear the cache (whatever cache exists)
redis-cli FLUSHALL
rm -rf /app/cache/*

# 3. Increase the memory limit
docker update --memory="4g" pandas-mcp-server

# 4. Disable that new feature
export ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURE=false
docker restart pandas-mcp-server

# 5. Switch to the backup service
export API_ENDPOINT=https://backup.api.com
docker restart pandas-mcp-server
```

### The Temporary Bandaids

```python
# Add to your emergency_patches.py
def emergency_patches():
    """
    Patches that will haunt you later
    """
    
    # Patch 1: Catch all exceptions (what could go wrong?)
    try:
        dangerous_operation()
    except:
        pass  # TODO: Fix this properly (you won't)
    
    # Patch 2: Infinite retry (it'll work eventually)
    while True:
        try:
            result = flaky_operation()
            break
        except:
            time.sleep(1)
            continue
    
    # Patch 3: Hardcode everything
    if production_is_on_fire():
        return {"status": "success", "data": "fake_data"}
```

## 📊 The Monitoring You Should Have Had

### Things to Check AFTER the Fire Is Out

```bash
# Set up actual monitoring (you won't)
cat > monitoring_ideas.txt << EOF
- CPU usage alerts (ignored)
- Memory usage alerts (also ignored)
- Disk space alerts (definitely ignored)
- Error rate monitoring (what's an acceptable error rate?)
- User complaint dashboard (Twitter search for "your app sucks")
- AI agent rebellion detection (check for "I'm sorry Dave" in logs)
EOF
```

### The Metrics That Matter

```python
REAL_METRICS = {
    "is_on_fire": True,
    "time_since_last_incident": "0 days",  # Reset counter
    "coffee_consumed": "7 cups",
    "tears_shed": "undefined",
    "will_to_live": 0.1,
    "messages_from_angry_customers": 47,
    "times_considered_career_change": 12
}
```

## 🎭 The Post-Mortem Theater

### The Blame Game Preparation

```markdown
## Incident Post-Mortem Template

**What Happened:** "The system experienced an unexpected interaction with reality"

**Root Cause:** 
- [ ] DNS
- [ ] Disk space
- [ ] Memory leak
- [ ] That PR we merged without reviewing
- [ ] Cosmic rays
- [x] All of the above

**Timeline:**
- 02:47 AM - System fails
- 02:48 AM - Monitoring fails to alert
- 03:15 AM - Customer tweets about it
- 03:16 AM - Manager sees tweet
- 03:17 AM - Your phone rings
- 03:18 AM - Contemplating career change
- 05:00 AM - Fixed by randomly changing things

**Lessons Learned:**
1. We should have monitoring (we won't implement it)
2. We should have tested this (we won't test next time either)
3. We should have documentation (lol)

**Action Items:**
- TODO: Set up monitoring (assigned to: intern who left)
- TODO: Write runbook (due: never)
- TODO: Fix technical debt (estimated: heat death of universe)
```

## 🚀 The Recovery Checklist

After you've stopped the bleeding:

- [ ] Verify the fix actually fixed it (not just moved the problem)
- [ ] Check if you broke something else while fixing
- [ ] Clear the Redis cache (when in doubt, clear cache)
- [ ] Restart all dependent services (break them too)
- [ ] Update the status page (from "Operational" to "Operational")
- [ ] Prepare the lie for the post-mortem
- [ ] Order pizza for the team (they deserve it)
- [ ] Update your resume (just in case)

## 💊 The Coping Mechanisms

### Healthy Approaches
- Take a walk (to the coffee machine)
- Practice deep breathing (while the logs load)
- Talk to someone (rubber duck debugging counts)
- Document the issue (future you will thank present you)
- Ask chatgpt. Seriously it helps

### Unhealthy but Realistic Approaches
- Blame the previous developer (they're not here to defend themselves)
- Claim it was a "learning experience" (you learned you hate this)
- Add more `try/except` blocks (exception handling is error handling, right?)
- Push to production on Friday (chaos is a ladder)

## 🎬 Final Words

Remember: Every production incident is a learning opportunity (to learn that you should have chosen a different career).

The key to surviving production fires:

1. **Stay calm** - Panic internally, debug externally
2. **Check the obvious** - It's usually disk space or DNS
3. **Document everything** - CYA is a valid strategy
4. **Rollback first** - Fix forward later
5. **Communicate** - Let people know you're suffering
6. **Learn nothing** - You'll do this again next week

**The Production Incident Mood Progression:**
- Denial: "The monitoring must be wrong"
- Anger: "Who deployed this?!"
- Bargaining: "If it starts working, I'll write tests"
- Depression: "Why do I do this job?"
- Acceptance: "At least it's not on fire anymore"

## 🏆 Achievement Unlocked

If you've made it through a production incident, you've earned:

- **"Firefighter"** - Fixed production at 3 AM
- **"Night Owl"** - Worked through the night
- **"Blame Deflector"** - Successfully blamed DNS
- **"Disk Space Liberator"** - Deleted logs in production
- **"Career Questioner"** - Googled "farming jobs" during incident
