### The Three Guides to Crisis Understanding

```

### Why Only Three Guides?

Because in a real emergency, you only need three things:
1. **What to do** - panic.md
2. **Who can help** - contacts.md  
3. **When to quit** - career-change.md

Everything else is just details.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is Educational

**This section teaches you about AI emergencies, not how to handle them.** You'll learn:
- What kinds of disasters happen with AI systems
- Why they happen (spoiler: usually human error)
- How others have failed before you
- Why you should be grateful you're just reading about it

Think of this as a museum of AI disasters - educational and slightly horrifying.

### Why Only Three Guides?

Because in a real emergency, you only need three things:
1. **What to do** - panic.md covers immediate response
2. **Who can help** - contacts.md lists actual resources
3. **Exit strategy** - career-change.md for when enough is enough

Everything else is just optimization of suffering.

## 🎯 The Disaster Decision Tree (Educational)

```
Is the AI on fire? (Metaphorically)
├─ Yes → Read panic.md for educational purposes
│   ├─ Still panicking? → Check contacts.md for who to call
│   └─ Considering life choices? → See career-change.md
└─ No → Why are you in the emergency section?
    ├─ Paranoid preparation → Good, keep reading
    ├─ Morbid curiosity → Understandable
    └─ Procrastinating → We've all been there
```

## 🚨 Quick Navigation for Crisis Types

| If You're Experiencing | You Should | We Suggest Reading |

## 💡 Lessons from Real Disasters

### The $72,000 Typo
> "Someone set max_tokens to 100000 instead of 1000. The monthly bill arrived. The company arrived at bankruptcy court."
> 
> **Lesson:** Always set spending limits

### The Helpful Assistant
> "We told the AI to be helpful. It helpfully provided users with internal API keys when asked nicely."
> 
> **Lesson:** Never trust AI with secrets

### The Creative Writer
> "Temperature set to 2.0 for 'creativity'. The AI told customers our product causes hallucinations. It wasn't wrong."
> 
> **Lesson:** Temperature above 1.0 is Russian roulette

### The Infinite Loop
> "Agent A asked Agent B for help. Agent B asked Agent A for clarification. They're still talking. The bill is $12,000."
> 
> **Lesson:** Always set recursion limits

### The Context Window Crisis
> "Increased context to 128k tokens for 'better memory'. Forgot each token costs money. Finance hasn't forgotten."
> 
> **Lesson:** Bigger context = bigger bills

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This section is for **educational purposes only**. It describes disasters that have happened to others (definitely not us, we would never). Any resemblance to actual disasters, ongoing or resolved, is purely coincidental.

If you're currently experiencing an actual AI emergency:
1. Don't panic (externally)
2. Read panic.md (won't help but interesting)
3. Check contacts.md (might help)
4. Consider career-change.md (always an option)
5. Remember: This too shall pass
