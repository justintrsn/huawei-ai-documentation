## 📖 A Letter to Future Survivors

Dear Future Huawei Employee,

If you're reading this, it means:
1. You've been asked to "work with AI"
2. The person who knew things has left (probably my mentor, possibly me)
3. You're googling "what is LLM" at 2 AM
4. You're wondering if it's too late to switch to a different project

First, breathe. Second, welcome to the club. Third, this guide exists because I've been there, and I refuse to let you suffer alone.

## 🎯 Why This Guide Exists (A Confession)

Woo Yan Kit - the ONLY person who actually understood LLMs and AI agents in this team - is leaving. I'm writing this while frantically taking notes, asking stupid questions, and pretending I understand when they explain things for the 47th time.

This guide is my attempt to document everything before the knowledge walks out the door. It's written in a sarcastic tone because:
- Technical documentation is boring enough to cause actual brain damage
- Laughing at our pain makes it hurt less
- If we're going to suffer, we might as well smile about it
- Serious guides make me want to quit tech and pursue OnlyFriends

**The Sacred Rule**: All future contributions MUST maintain the sarcastic, self-deprecating tone. We're not just building AI systems; we're building a support group disguised as documentation.

## 🎬 Final Words

To whoever reads this:

You're about to embark on a journey that's fascinating but mostly frustrating. You'll build things that seem like magic, and you'll spend hours debugging things that make no sense. You'll feel like a genius one moment and an idiot the next.

This is normal.

The AI field moves so fast that everything you learn today will be obsolete tomorrow. The model that works perfectly in development will hallucinate in production. The prompt that generated perfect results will suddenly start returning recipes for banana bread.
This guide is designed to teach you **concepts and a bit of implementation**. You'll learn:
- Why things break (constantly)
- How others have failed (spectacularly)
- What solutions exist (theoretically)
- Why simple is better (always)


Remember:
- Document everything (your future self will thank you)
- It's okay to not understand everything
- The experts are also googling things
- If it works, don't touch it
- If it doesn't work, try adding "please" to your prompt
- When all else fails, blame the context window
- Follow the deployment guides in order (seriously, don't skip steps)
- **It's okay to not understand** - Nobody really does
- **When in doubt, restart** - It works 60% of the time
- **Sarcasm helps** - It's how we cope

Keep the sarcasm alive. Keep documenting the pain. And most importantly, help the next person who stumbles into this chaos.

Good luck. You'll need it.
